This project demonstares below points-

1. How to develope loosely coupled microservices which communicates with each other  through Zuul API gateway 
2. How you can develop Microservices without hardcoded endpoints Eureka discovery  
3. How to generates logs with trace id and span id using Sleuth, which in turn can be easily queried using  Zipkin server, 
  in this solution Zipkin is not configured to keep things simple.  
4. API versioning is implemented using URI versioning due to explicit nature and  simplicity.
